X.org graphics driver for OMAP AM57x

Features:
- EXA and Xv GC320 2D acceleration with etnaviv
- DRI2 & DRI3

Kernel version note for etnaviv driver:
- 4.4x is not tested anymore
- There is a bug in etnaviv driver in 4.9x, missing mutex make kernel to hang : https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/drivers/gpu/drm/etnaviv/etnaviv_gem.c#L557
- It seems this is fixed in 4.14x (untested): https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/drivers/gpu/drm/etnaviv/etnaviv_gem.c#L561

This driver only use GC320 2D capabilities to provide X11 acceleration, it does not give any 3D acceleration.
For 3D acceleration, you could use https://github.com/TexasInstruments/dri3wsegl which is a DRI3 plugin for PVR SGX 544MP 3D chip available in AM57x. You just need to install SGX drivers and dri3wsegl as documented in the repository. Once done, just restart the X server to activate acceleration in omap5 X11. You can then check if the driver is activated using eglinfo:
