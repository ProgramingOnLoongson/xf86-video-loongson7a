/*
                         Theory of Operation

The XFree86 common layer has knowledge of generic access control mechanisms
for devices on certain bus systems (currently the PCI bus) as well as of
methods to enable or disable access to the buses itself. Furthermore it
can access information on resources decoded by these devices and if
necessary modify it.


When first starting the Xserver collects all this information,
saves it for restoration, checks it for consistency, and if necessary,
corrects it. Finally it disables all resources on a generic level prior
to calling any driver function.


When the Probe() function of each driver is called the device sections
are matched against the devices found in the system. The driver may probe
devices at this stage that cannot be identified by using device independent
methods.

Access to all resources that can be controlled in a device independent way
is disabled. The Probe() function should register all non-relocatable
resources at this stage. If a resource conflict is found between exclusive
resources the driver will fail immediately.
